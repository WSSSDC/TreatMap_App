# Treatz
***Arjun Sarao, Bram Ogus, Connor Wilson***

## 💡 Inspiration
Finding some tool to maximise candy collection on halloween has been a dream of ours since childhood.

## 📱 What it does
Treatz gamifies the process of collecting candies.

## 🛠 How we built it
 - **Adobe XD**: We designed the mockups in Adobe XD to figure out the UI/UX
 - **Flutter**: We built the frontend in Flutter
 - **GO**: We created the backend in GO
 - **Firebase**: We also made our backend with firebase

## 🛑 Challenges we ran into
- Issues with GO syntax
- Making our GO backend communicate with the frontend and firebase
- A tree fell onto one of our teammates houses, taking out his internet

## ✅ Accomplishments that we're proud of
 - Writing our own from-scratch GO backend, this was the first time our team used GO in a hackathon project
 - 

## 📖 What we learned
 - Gin web framework for GO, it allows you to run an API on the web
 - Using types structs in GO
 - Making GO communicate with Firebase
 - Getting direction coordinates from the maps API in Flutter 

## 🤔 What's next for Treatz
 - Add different themes
 - Add geotagging to automagically add candies to your score
 - Add teams so you can compete along side your friends and family
 - Dynamically allocating point value to candies to incentivies collecting rarer types candy
 - ML, duh
